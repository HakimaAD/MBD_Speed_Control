MBD Speed Control – Project Documentation
1. Introduction

The MBD Speed Control project aims to develop a vehicle speed control system using Model-Based Design (MBD). The system handles different situations: Normal driving, Alert, and Braking.

1.1 Objectives

Maintain vehicle speed within defined limits.

Detect situations requiring a driver alert.

Activate automatic braking in critical overspeed situations.

Generate C code automatically from the Simulink/Stateflow model.

2. System Architecture
2.1 Simulink Blocks

Input Block: Vehicle speed sensors, user commands.

Control Logic: Stateflow chart managing Normal, Alert, and Braking states.

Output Block: Motor commands, alert signals, brake activation.

2.2 System States
State	Description
Normal	Vehicle operates at normal speed with no alert.
Alert	Speed approaches critical limit; visual or auditory alert triggered.
Braking	Critical overspeed; automatic braking is activated.
3. Functionality Description
3.1 Normal Driving

Vehicle operates normally.

Speed is regulated according to the setpoint.

Sensors continuously monitor speed and environment.

3.2 Alert

Triggered when speed approaches a critical limit.

Generates a driver alert interface notification.

Prepares the system for potential automatic braking.

3.3 Braking

Triggered if speed exceeds the critical limit.

Activates automatic braking via brake system.

Can only reset after returning to a safe state.

4. Stateflow Diagram

Stateflow Chart:

States: Normal → Alert → Braking

Transitions based on speed thresholds.

Actions defined for each state (alert,  braking).

5. Generated C Code

Automatically generated from the Simulink model.

Typical structure:

initialize(): Initializes the system and variables.

step(): Executes control at each cycle.

terminate(): Releases resources.

Generated files:

SpeedControl.c

SpeedControl.h

SpeedControl_ert_rtw/ 

6. Testing and Validation

Unit testing for each chart state.

Simulation under normal and extreme conditions.

Verification of state transitions (Normal → Alert → Braking).

Comparison of simulated results with expected behavior.

7. System Requirements
7.1 High-Level Requirements (HLR)

Define what the system must achieve at a global level.

Examples:

The system shall maintain vehicle speed within defined limits.

The system shall alert the driver if the speed approaches a critical threshold.

The system shall activate automatic braking in case of dangerous overspeed.

7.2 Low-Level Requirements (LLR)

Define how each HLR will be implemented technically.

Examples:

The PID controller adjusts the motor command every 10 ms to keep speed within ±1 km/h of the setpoint.

An interface notification is activated when speed exceeds 90% of the limit.

The braking signal is automatically sent to the motor module when speed exceeds the critical threshold.

8. Conclusion

The MBD Speed Control project demonstrates the efficiency of Model-Based Design for vehicle speed management with integrated safety. Automatic transitions between Normal, Alert, and Braking states ensure a reliable and safe control system.
